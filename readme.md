## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/proxy-hub.git
cd proxy-hub
2. Launch it
Just open index.html in your browser. That’s it.

No server or backend needed (unless you're integrating dynamic APIs or admin features).

✨ Adding Proxies
If you're not using a backend, just update the array manually in script.js:

js
Copy
Edit
const proxies = [
  {
    name: 'Ultraviolet',
    url: 'https://uv.yoursite.com',
    logo: 'https://yoursite.com/assets/uv.png'
  },
  {
    name: 'Rammerhead',
    url: 'https://rh.yoursite.com',
    logo: 'https://yoursite.com/assets/rh.png'
  }
];
Want to load proxies from a database or API? Add a route like /api/proxies that returns JSON and modify loadProxies() accordingly.
